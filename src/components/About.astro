          I'm currently designing and developing real-time threat intelligence
          software. I'm especially interested in learning more about
          infrastructure, security, and how AI is reshaping the way we approach
          both design and development.

          Outside of work, I enjoy running and hanging out with my coworkers
          Clark and Fionn (they're dogs, but donâ€™t tell them that).

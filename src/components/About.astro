                    I'm a designer and developer building performant,
                    accessible, and scalable software. I specialize in
                    UX, UI architecture, and component-driven design
                    systems.

                    I’ve recently been diving deeper into security and
                    networking. I enjoy working across disciplines and bridging
                    the gap between design and engineering. Always learning,
                    always building.

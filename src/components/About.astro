                    in my current role I am designing and developing real-time
                    threat intelligence software for GSOCs and security
                    professionals.

                    <p>
                        As a lifelong learner I am constantly diving into new
                        areas of expertise and am especially interested in
                        learning more about infrastructure, security, and how AI
                        is reshaping the way we approach both design and
                        development.

                        Outside of work, I enjoy running and hanging out with my
                        coworkers Clark and Fionn (they're dogs, but don’t tell
                        them that).

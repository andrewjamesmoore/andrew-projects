          in my current role I am designing and developing real-time threat
          intelligence software for GSOCs and security professionals.

          <p>
            As a lifelong learner I am constantly diving into new areas of
            expertise and am especially interested in learning more about
            infrastructure, security, and how AI is reshaping the way we
            approach both design and development.

            Outside of work, I enjoy running and hanging out with my coworkers
            Clark and Fionn (they're dogs, but donâ€™t tell them that).

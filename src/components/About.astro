          I’m a designer and developer with 15+ years of experience building on
          the web. Over the past 4 years, I’ve focused on software design and
          development—-crafting performant, accessible, and scalable user
          interfaces. My strengths lie in UX, UI architecture, and
          component-driven design systems.

          I’ve recently been diving deeper into security and networking. I enjoy
          working across disciplines and bridging the gap between design and
          engineering. Always learning, always building.
